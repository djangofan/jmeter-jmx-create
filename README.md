# jmeter-jmx-create

Create a Jmeter .jmx file from Java code.

# Plans

Currently not yet working.

Jmeter currently marshals .jmx files using XStream but I have not figured out yet where there Java bean code is for building a JMX manually in Java code.   If they don't have one, I will try to make a simple one.
